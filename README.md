# Land Use Model with Environmental Nexus

## WHAT IS LUMEN?
*Land Use Model with Environmental Nexus* (LUMEN) is a modular open source model 
for modeling global land-systems, which derives most of if its inputs from the 
IMPACT model developed by IFPRI. It takes regional economic conditions such as 
demand for agricultural commodities and production costs into account. Based on 
these, the model derives land use patterns, yields and total costs of agricultural 
production for each country (ISO3 level). 

The objective function of the land use model is to minimize total cost of production 
for a given amount of country level commodity (food) demand.

## NOTES
Following the principles of good scientific practice it is recommended
to make the source code available in the events of model based publications
or model-based consulting.

When using a modified version of **LUMEN** which is not identical to versions
in the official main repository at https://github.com/abhimishr/LUMEN **must** 
add a suffix to the name to allow distinguishing versions (format **LUMEN-suffix**).

## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
The model is not resource heavy but works best on machines with high CPU clock
and memory. Recommended is a machine with Windows, MacOS or Linux, with at least
16GB of memory and a Core i7 CPU or similar.

## HOW TO INSTALL
LUMEN requires *GAMS* (https://www.gams.com/) including licenses for the
solvers *CONOPT* for its core calculations. 
As the model benefits significantly of recent improvements in *GAMS* and 
*CONOPT4* it is recommended to work with the most recent versions of both.
Please make sure that the GAMS installation path is added to the PATH variable
of the system.

In addition *R* (https://www.r-project.org/) is required for pre- and
postprocessing and run management (needs to be added to the PATH variable
as well).

## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE
We are interested in working with you! Just contact us through GitHub
(https://github.com/abhimishr/LUMEN) or by mail (A.Mishra@cgiar.org) if you have
found and/or fixed a bug, developed a new model feature, have ideas for further
model development, suggestions for improvements or anything else. We are open to
any kind of contribution. Our aim is to develop an open, transparent and
meaningful model of the agricultural land use sector to get a better
understanding of the underlying processes and possible futures. Join us doing
so!
